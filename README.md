# ngx-ui-router-url-type-factory

ngx-ui-router-url-type-factory is an Angular library that helps you creating ui-router url matcher types that resolve 
the ID component in a URL to the actual resource instance. This way you do not need to bother with fetching the data in 
your controllers, redirecting to 404 pages when the fetch was unsuccessful, and dealing with all the permission stuff.

**Note:** This library is for Angular 5.x and above!


## In development

This library is currently in an early stage of development and is missing a proper documentation.
